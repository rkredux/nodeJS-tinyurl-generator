Welcome to NodeJS tiny url generator. 


This NodeJS application uses ExpressJS and Node's native Crypto module to generate random tiny URL to make absurdly long URL into easily shareable small URLs. 

For demo hop over to https://tinymeup.glitch.me/ and input your URL using either https:// or http:// url constructs. 

If the url is invalid the application will not shorten your URL. 

Use and share this application!
